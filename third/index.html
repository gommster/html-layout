            are actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people
            retrieve it (and the appropriate app UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a comelling
            reason to do so, avoid definig a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar
            because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it.
